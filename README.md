# Wave3

Wave3 is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to wave at me by making an Ethereum transaction on the Goerli testnet. Each user's waves are recorded on the blockchain, and a leaderboard displays the users who have waved the most times. Users can only wave once every 24 hours.

This repository is the front-end of Wave3 (React + Typescript).

## Set up

To set up and run the dApp locally:

1. Clone the repository : `git clone https://github.com/aurelien-ch/wave-3-front.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## How it works

1. Connect your Metamask wallet
2. Switch to the Goerli test network
3. Claim some fake ETH here : https://goerlifaucet.com/
4. Click the "Wave at me" button to send a wave transaction
